# Block-structured-random-matrices

Initially, Random Matrix Theory (RMT) was born due to Eugene Wigner in physics. It serves as a powerful statistical model to study large systems with network structure. Biological systems like gene regulatory network, protein-protein interaction network and ecological system network are usually large and complex. Thus RMT can be applied in its full potential to extract important information about them. Block-structured random matrix is a more realistic model to study the ecosystem of modular organization. To study the stability of an ecosystem, it suffices to know the rightmost eigenvalue of the radnom matrix. One naive method is to generate all eigenvalue by brute force and locate the rightmost eigenvalue. But this demands high time complexity as S grows. In this project, we will see how random matrix theory and cavity method sheds a light to optimize this problem. 

Note: 
1) main.pdf is the project report I completed during my stay at ICTP, Italy. It is a mini project for my completion of the visiting program at ICTP. 
2) To use the code, open all of the files, and run the file BlockMatrices.py. It should give the position of the eigenvalues of a random matrix $M$.
